                    After a document is created on the computer, it can be sent to a printer for a hard
                    copy on paper. Some printers supports only black & white prints where as others
                    support color print outs. Some of the most commonly used type of printers are :
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Laser Printer</li>
                    <li>Ink Jet Printer</li>
                    <li>Dot Matrix Printer</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <b>Laser Printers</b> : A laser printer produces high quality print that one normally
                    finds in publishing. It is extremely fast and quiet. Moreover, the operation of
                    a laser printer is easy with automatic paper loading. The fastest laser printer
                    can print up to 200 pages per minute in black and white and up to 100 pages per
                    minute in color.</p>

                    <b>Ink-Jet Printers</b> : An ink-jet printer creates an image directly on paper
                    by spraying ink through as many as 64 tiny nozzles. Although the image it produces
                    is not generally quite as sharp as the output of a laser printer, the quality of
                    ink-jet images is still high. In general, ink-jet printer offers an excellent middle
                    ground between dot matrix and laser printer. Like laser printer, an ink-jet printer
                    is quiet and convenient, but not particularly fast. Typically, an ink-jet printer
                    is more expensive than a dot-matrix printer, but costs only half as much as a laser
                    printer.</p>

                    <b>Dot Matrix Printers</b> : The dot matrix printer was very popular at one point
                    of time. It is a very versatile and inexpensive output device. In dot matrix printer
                    the print head physically "hits" the paper through the ribbon and produces text
                    (or images) by combinations of dots; hence the name dot matrix printer. Its speed
                    is measured in characters per second (CPS). Although it is less expensive, it is
                    louder, slower and produces lower print quality.
