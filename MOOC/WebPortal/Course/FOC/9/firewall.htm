                    A firewall helps keep your computer more secure. A firewall restricts information
                    that comes to your computer from other computers and gives you more control over
                    the data on your computer. Additionally, a firewall provides a line of defense against
                    people or programs, including viruses and worms that try to connect to your computer
                    without invitation.</p>
                <p>
                    E.g. Firewall is like security personnel standing at the gate of commercial malls.
                    They checks you, your baggage etc. before allowing to enter into mall. Similarly
                    Firewall checks programs before allowing them to access your computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Windows Firewall is turned on by default, some computer manufacturers and
                    network administrators may turn it off. You do not have to use Windows Firewall.
                    You can install and run any firewall that you want. If you decide to install and
                    run another firewall, turn off Windows Firewall.</p>
