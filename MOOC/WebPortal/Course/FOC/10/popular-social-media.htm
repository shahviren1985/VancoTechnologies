                    <i><b>YouTube</b></i></p>
                <p>
                    When we talk about social media we immediately think of Facebook, Twitter and even
                    MySpace, but often overlook the video option of <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.
                    To help you understand the value of YouTube considers the following statistics :</p>
                <p>
                    YouTube has several categories that you can upload videos to. They include :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Autos and Vehicles</li>
                    <li>Comedy</li>
                    <li>Education</li>
                    <li>Entertainment</li>
                    <li>Film and Animation</li>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>How-to and Style</li>
                    <li>Nonprofit and Activism</li>

                    <li>Pets and Animals</li>
                    <li>Science and Technology</li>
                    <li>Sports</li>
                    <li>Travel and Events</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The fact is that YouTube is another effective way to utilize social media marketing
                    and the cost is minimal if any at all. If you can create videos that share value
                    and interaction with consumers you can post those videos to an audience.</p>

                <p>

                    create and manage theme-based image collections such as events, interests, and hobbies.
                    Users can browse other pin boards for images, "<i>re-pin</i>" images to their own
                    pin boards, or "<i>like</i>" photos.
                </p>

                    <i><b>WhatsApp Messenger</b></i></p>
                <p>
                    <b>WhatsApp Messenger</b> is a cross-platform mobile messaging app which allows
                    you to exchange messages without having to pay for SMS. WhatsApp Messenger is available
                    for iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Windows Phone and some Nokia; these phones can
                    all message each other!</p>
                <p>
                    Because WhatsApp Messenger uses the same internet data plan that you use for email
                    and web browsing, there is no cost to message and stay in touch with your friends.</p>
                <p>
                    In addition to basic messaging WhatsApp users can create groups, send each other
                    unlimited images, video and audio media messages.</p>
