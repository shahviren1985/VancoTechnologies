                    <i><b>Keep your passwords secret</b></i></p>
                <p>
                    Kids create online user names and passwords for school, game websites, social networking,
                    posting photos, shopping, and more. <b>The first rule of Internet safety is: keep passwords
                        secret.</b> Here are some rules that you should know and follow.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Don't reveal passwords to others.</b> Keep your passwords hidden, even from friends.</li>
                    <li><b>Protect recorded passwords.</b> Be careful where you store passwords that you
                        record or write down. Don't store passwords in your backpack or wallet. Don't leave
                        records of your passwords anywhere that you would not leave the information that
                        the passwords protect. Don't store your passwords on a file in your computer. Criminals
                        look there first.</li>
                    <li><b>Never provide your password over email or in response to an email request.</b>
                        Any email message that requests your password or requests that you to go to a website
                        to verify your password could be a fraud.</li>
                    <li>This includes requests from trusted sites that you might visit all the time. Fraudsters
                        often create fake email messages with logos and language from real sites.</li>
                    <li><b>Do not type passwords on computers that you do not control.</b> Avoid using public
                        computers in your school, library, Internet cafes, or computer labs for anything
                        other than anonymous Internet browsing.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <div class="img1">

                    <p>
                        Use social networking safely
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <i><b>Use social networking safely</b></i></p>
                <p>
                    You should understand that many of these social networking sites can be viewed by
                    anyone with access to the Internet. As a result, some of the information they post
                    can make them vulnerable to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/online-privacy/phishing-symptoms.aspx">
                        phishing scams</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/family-safety/cyberbullying.aspx">
                            cyberbullying</a>, and Internet predators. Here are several ways to help
                    kids use social networking sites safely.</p>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Stop accessing websites which makes you feel anxious, uncomfortable, or threatened.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that you follow age limit. E.g. signup for the Facebook account requires
                        your age above 13 years</li>
                    <li>Educate yourself about privacy policy of website, check if website monitors your
                        content.</li>
                    <li><b>Never meet anyone in person with whom you have only communicated online.</b>
                        You are in real danger when you meet strangers in person whom you've communicated
                        with online only.</li>
                    <li><b>Communicate only with people you already know.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Don't use full names.</b> Use only a first name or nickname, but not a nickname
                        that would attract inappropriate attention. Don’t post the full names of your friends
                        either.</li>
                    <li><b>Consider using a site that is not very public.</b> Some websites allow you to
                        password-protect your site or use other methods to help limit viewers to only people
                        you know. With Windows Live Spaces, for example, you can set permissions for who
                        can view your site, ranging from anyone on the Internet to only people you choose.</li>
                    <li><b>Be smart about details in photographs.</b> Don’t post photographs of you and
                        your friend with clearly identifiable details such as street signs, license plates
                        on your cars etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Cyber bullying.</b> Be aware of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/family-safety/cyberbullying.aspx">
                        cyber bullying</a>. Share information right away with your parent, a teacher, or
                        another adult that you trust.</li>
                </ul>
               
                <p>
                    <i><b>Blogging</b></i></p>
                <p>
                    It is the practice of blogging, short for keeping a "web log" or an online personal
                    journal.</p>
                <p>
                    Although keeping a blog offers potential benefits including improved writing skills
                    and communication, it's important that you don't reveal too much.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Establish rules for online use</b></li>
                    <li><b>Ask yourself if you are comfortable showing any of the content to a stranger.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Evaluate the blogging service</b> and find out if it offers private, password-protected
                        blogs.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>
                    <i><b>Beware of online fraud</b></i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Never share personal information.</b> Don't give out personal information, such
                        as your full name or hometown, in an instant message (IM) or a chat room unless
                        you are certain of the identity of the person with whom you are chatting.</li>
                    <li><b>Log off from your account.</b> If you use computers in a library or Internet
                        cafe, log off completely before you leave. You don't know what software is installed
                        on these computers or what it does and it might have keystroke tracking software
                        installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Create secure passwords and keep them secret.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Use only secure sites.</b> You should be sure that the URL of any site where
                        you enter financial information begins with https:// and features a yellow lock
                        icon in the bottom right corner or a green address bar.</li>
                    <li><b>Recognize and report fraud.</b> Preapproved credit card offers, calls from collection
                        agencies, or unfamiliar financial statements are possible starting point of frauds.
                        If you suspect identity fraud, take action immediately to limit the damage. Contact
                        your credit card company, banks and the police. Close any fraudulent accounts, and
                        tell them to change your passwords for all online accounts. Keep records of all
                        actions that you've taken.</li>
                </ul>
