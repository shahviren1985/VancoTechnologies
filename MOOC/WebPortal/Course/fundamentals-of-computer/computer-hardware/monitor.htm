                    Monitor is the most important output device because people interact with this device
                    most intensively. Information processed within the computer processor, that needs
                    to be visually displayed, is sent to video adapter. The video adapter converts information
                    from the format used, in the same manner as a television displays information sent
                    to it by a cable service.

                <ol>
                    <li>Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)</li>
                    <li>Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)</li>
                    <li>LED</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <b>Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)</b> : CRT is the typical monitor that you see on a desktop
                    computer. It looks a lot like a television screen, and works the same way. This
                    type uses a large vacuum tube, called cathode ray tube (CRT). Nowadays, these monitors
                    are considered outdated.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)</b> : This type of monitors is also known as flat
                    panel monitor. Most of these employ liquid crystal displays (LCDs) to render images.
                    These days LCD monitor are very popular. When people talk about the capabilities
                    of various monitors, one critical statistic is the resolution of the monitor.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>LED</b> : An LED display is a flat panel display, which uses light-emitting diodes
                    as a video display.
