                    When you switch on the computer the programs called system software are executed
                    that make the computer ready for you to work on it. System software consists of sets of programs,
                    responsible for running the computer, controlling various operations of computer
                    systems and management of computer resources. E.g. Operating System (OS) falls under
                    this category.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>An operating system</b> is system software that provides an interface for a user
                    to communicate with the computer. It manages hardware devices and supports application
                    programs. Some popular Operating systems are Microsoft Windows, MAC OS, Linux and UNIX.
                    Although operating system provides all the features usually needed to use and maintain
                    the systems, inevitably, they still do not meet everyone’s expectations. This has
                    led to another type of system software called <i>Utilities</i>.</p>
                <b>Utility programs</b>
                <br />
                <p>
                    These are programs that bridge the gap between the functionality of operating systems
                    and the needs of users. Utility programs are a broad category of software such as
                    compress (zip)/uncompress (unzip) files software, anti-virus software, split and
                    join files software, etc.</p>
