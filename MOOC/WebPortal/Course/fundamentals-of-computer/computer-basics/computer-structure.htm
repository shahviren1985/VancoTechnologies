                    Computer is a device which takes input from the user, processes this data and produces
                    the output. It could process both numerical as well as non-numerical calculations.
                    Computer functions are categorized in to following major categories:</p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Input – It accepts data or instruction in the form of input.</li>
                    <li>Processing – It can process data as required by the user.</li>
                    <li>Output – It gives results in the form of output</li>
                    <li>Storage – It stores the input data and the output data</li>
                </ol>

                        Basic computer structure
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Details about these basic computer components are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Input Unit : This unit helps in the process of entering data and programs into the
                        computer system.</li>
                    <li>Control Unit (CU) : The function of input, output, processing and storage of data
                        is performed under the supervision of a unit called Control Unit. It decides when
                        to start receiving data, when to stop it, where to store data, etc. It takes care
                        of step -by-step processing of all operations inside the computer.</li>
                    <li>Memory Unit : This unit is used to store data</li>
                    <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) : The major operations performed by the ALU are addition,
                        subtraction, multiplication, division, logical and comparisons.</li>
                    <li>Output Unit : This unit helps in the process of displaying results from the processed
                        data. Data is turned into useful information and delivered to user via output devices.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The Arithmetic Logic Unit and the Control Unit of a computer system are jointly
                    known as the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU is the brain of computer systems.</p>
                <p>
                    The major characteristics of a computer are high speed, accuracy, diligence, versatility
                    and storage.</p>
