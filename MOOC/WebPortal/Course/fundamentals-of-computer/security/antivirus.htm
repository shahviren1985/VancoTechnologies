                    <b>Computer viruses</b> are software programs that are deliberately designed to
                    interfere with computer operation; record, corrupt, or delete data; or spread themselves
                    to other computers and throughout the Network/Internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Antivirus software</b> is a computer program that detects, prevents, and takes
                    action to disarm or remove malicious software programs, such as viruses and worms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your computer starts to behave strangely, you might be experiencing spyware symptoms
                    or have other unwanted software installed on your computer. A virus scan detects
                    viruses that are able to infect your computer with devastating results.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Without protection your computer may be rendered slow by the presence of a virus
                        or completely destroyed by the deletion of all of your important files.</li>
                    <li>By installing antivirus protection, a virus scanner searches your system to detect
                        the presence of a virus within applications, such as email. </li>
                    <li>Virus scanner checks for traces of viruses, malware or spyware and any other potential
                        threat to your computer. </li>
                    <li>The contents of your files will only be scanned for harmful items, instating safety
                        whilst ensuring personal privacy.</li>
