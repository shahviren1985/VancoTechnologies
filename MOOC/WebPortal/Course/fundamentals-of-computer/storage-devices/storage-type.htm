                    there are primarily two types of storage a computer uses :
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Primary storage</b>, which is temporary memory. The information present in temporary
                        memory is lost when computer is turned off</li>
                    <li><b>Secondary storage</b>, which is permanent memory. The information present in
                        permanent memory persist even when computer is turned off</li>
                </ol>
                <b>Primary Storage</b>
                <p>
                    Data required for current processing or data that will be required in near future
                    by the processor is stored in primary storage. Data present in primary storage can
                    be accessed quickly by the CPU. Its storage capacity, however, is much smaller than
                    what can be stored in secondary storage. Computers need just enough primary storage
                    to function and temporarily hold anticipated amounts of data for processing.</p>
                <b>Secondary storage</b>
                <p>
                    Data which is not required for current processing but may be needed at some time
                    in the future is stored in secondary storage. Secondary storage is non-volatile
                    in nature because data remains intact even when power to a computer is turned off.
                    Operating systems, documents, music files and so on are typically stored in a secondary
                    storage device such as a hard drive.
